[00:21.90] You walk on like a woman in suffering
[00:26.00] Won't even bother now to tell me why
[00:30.10] You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment
[00:34.90] Leaving me broken another time
[00:39.00] You come on like a bloodstained hurricane
[00:43.10] Leave me alone, let me be this time
[00:47.20] You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
[00:52.00] I don't want to mention, the reason I know
[00:56.10] That I am stricken and can't let you go
[01:00.50] When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
[01:04.90] That I am crippled by all that you've done
[01:09.00] Into the abyss will I run
[01:16.90] You don't know what your power has done to me
[01:21.10] I want to know if I'll heal inside
[01:25.30] I can't go on with a holocaust about to happen
[01:30.10] Seeing you laughing another time
[01:34.30] You'll never know how your face has haunted me
[01:38.50] My very soul has to bleed this time
[01:42.80] Another hole in the wall of my inner defenses
[01:47.70] Leaving me breathless, the reason
[01:51.90] I know that I am stricken and can't let you go
[01:56.30] When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
[02:00.70] That I am crippled by all that you've done
[02:04.90] Into the abyss will I run
[02:09.00] Into the abyss will I run
[02:17.00] You walk on like a woman in suffering
[02:21.10] Won't even bother now to tell me why
[02:25.30] You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment
[02:30.00] Leaving me broken another time
[02:34.10] You come on like a bloodstained hurricane
[02:38.30] Leave me alone, let me be this time
[02:42.50] You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption
[02:47.20] I don't want to mention, the reason
[02:51.40] I know that I am stricken and can't let you go
[02:55.80] When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know
[03:00.20] That I am crippled by all that you've done
[03:04.40] Into the abyss will I run
[03:08.60] Into the abyss will I run
[03:17.10] I can't let you go
[03:21.50] Yes, I am stricken and can't let you go
