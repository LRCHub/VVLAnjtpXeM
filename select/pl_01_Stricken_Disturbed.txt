you walk on like a
woman in suffering
won't even bother
now to tell me why
you come alone
letting all of us savor
the moment
leaving me broken
another time
you come on like a
bloodstained hurricane
leave me alone
let me be this time
you carry on like a holy man
pushing redemption
I don't want to mention
the reason I know
that I am stricken
and can't let you go
when the heart is cold
there's no hope and we know
that I am crippled by all
that you've done
into the abyss will I run
<♪>
you don't know what
your power has done to me
I want to know
if I'll heal inside
I can't go on with a
holocaust about to happen
seeing you laughing
another time
you'll never know how
your face has haunted me
my very soul has
to bleed this time
another hole in the wall
of my inner defenses
leaving me breathless
the reason I know
that I am stricken and
can't let you go
when the heart is cold
there's no hope
and we know
that I am crippled by
all that you've done
into the abyss will I run
<♪>
into the abyss will I run
<♪>
