Living too fast, dying so young
Out go the living
- Heroes unsung -

Life is to live, for all that its worth
Taken by death
- Removed from the earth -

Priests bear the cross, all mourn the dead
A life lived too fast
- Death lies ahead -

No time to slow down, your fight for your life
Dazed by comparison
- Stricken by might -

- Hatred - no force to be denied
- The last - to reckon with, you're set on fire
- Sacred - a heart that you hold so dear
- Fighting - toward hell, engulfed by your fear
